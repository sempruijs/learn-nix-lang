# Nix

This is for storing files that I use for learning the Nix language.

I follow [this tutorial from nix.dev](https://nix.dev/tutorials/first-steps/nix-language)

## Run an example

To run an exmaple, make sure Nix is installed and enter the following command:

```Shell
nix-instantiate --eval <FILENAME>ghghkk 
```
